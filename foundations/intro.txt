introduction of this chapter.

designing and analyzing the algorithm.
1. how to specify the algorithm. 
2. how to design the algorithm. 
3.fundemental ideas used in algorithem analysis.


chapter 1 :
Overview of algo. 


chapter 2 :
First algo :  sorting a n numbers. 
presudocode : the structure of the algorithm. 
 -> insertion sort : incremental approach 
 -> merge sort  : divide and conquer
expression to notate the running time .


chapter 3:
about the notation :  asymptotic notation.
presentation of mathematical notation.


chapter 4:  
divide and conquer -> further. 
Additional divide and conquer algorithms , including the strassen's surprising method for multiplying two square matrices. 
Solving recurrences m useful for describing the running times of recursicve algorithms. 
The correctness of the master method. 


chapter 5: 
probailistic and randomized algorithms,
